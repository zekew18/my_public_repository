# my_public_repository

+ This is my personal repository, hosting a few of my minor projects.
+ Proper documentation/comments are a work-in-progress, as are many other features I would like to add.
+ Some of these projects I might completely redo at some future point. I hope repository demonstrates my knowledge of python and shows how I logically programming approach.
